# Frog_Heiraichal_Models

This assignment has two parts. The first part (A) involves modelilng and animation of a frog with following features.

The modeling of frog needs to be represented as a hierarchical model with an articulated structure. The model can be seen as a tree.
The primitives to model a frog should be from OpenGL primitves.
The model should be texture mapped.
The hierarchical model defines a heirarchy where a transformation when applied to a node in the tree its sub tree inherits the transformation.
The animation module will involve defining some key frames of the frog, which may form a jump when interpolated. The parameter of interpolation can be correlated with time.
You can change the parameter of interpolation to perform variation in the way a jump takes place.
You need to show number of jumps starting from a source point to a destination point of the frog.

The second part (B) will involve a frog and insect game. The idea here is that an insect is defined as some simple shape which can be moved through the mouse as the mouse is moved on a plane. The frog attempts to follow and try to eat the insect. The game is over if the frog eats the insect or if the total elapsed time is more than a limit. The movement e.g., speed of the frog may be controlled through a key press.

This part (B) also has a bonus component for creativly using multiple frogs and insects. You are required to create a scenario with multiple frogs and insects and show their interactions.
